= Creating a network mapping

You can create one or more network mappings by using the {ocp} web console to map source networks to {virt} networks.

.Prerequisites

* Source and target providers added to the {ocp} web console.
* If you map more than one source and target network, each additional {virt} network requires its own link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-version}/html/virtualization/virtual-machines#virt-creating-network-attachment-definition[network attachment definition].

.Procedure

. In the {ocp} web console, click *Migration* -> *NetworkMaps for virtualization*.
. Click *Create NetworkMap*.
. Complete the following fields:

* *Name*: Enter a name to display in the network mappings list.
* *Source provider*: Select a source provider.
* *Target provider*: Select a target provider.
+
The *Source networks* and *Target namespaces/networks* text boxes become active.

. Select a source network and a target namespace/network from the list.
. Optional: To save your mapping as a template, select *Save current mapping as a template* and enter a name for your mapping.
. Optional: Click *Add* to create additional network mappings or to map multiple source networks to a single target network.
. If you create an additional network mapping, select the network attachment definition as the target network.
. Click *Create*.
+
The network mapping is displayed on the *NetworkMaps* screen.
