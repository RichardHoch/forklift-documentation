= Creating a network mapping

You can create one or more network mappings by using the {project-short} web console to map source networks to {virt} networks.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot map an opaque network, typically managed by NSX, to {a-virt} network.
====

.Prerequisites

* Source and target providers added to the web console.
* If you create multiple network mappings, you must create a network attachment definition for each additional target network. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp-version}/virt/virtual_machines/vm_networking/virt-attaching-vm-multiple-networks.html#virt-creating-network-attachment-definition[Creating a network attachment definition] in _OpenShift Virtualization_.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must specify `br1` as the *Bridge Name* of the network attachment definition.
====
