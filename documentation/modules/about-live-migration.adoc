= About live migration

[role="_abstract"]
You can use _live migration_ to migrate virtual machines (VMs) between {virt} clusters, or between namespaces on the same {virt} cluster, with extremely limited downtime.

Live migration is supported by {project-first} version 2.10.0 and later. It requires {virt} 4.20 or later on both your source and target clusters. 

Live migration makes it easier for you to perform Day 2 tasks, such as seamless maintenance and workload balancing after you have migrated your VMs to {virt}.
