[id="warm-migration-stages_{context}"]
= Warm migration in {project-short}

[role="_abstract"]
Warm migration in {project-first} includes the following two stages:

[id="mtv-cold-warm-migration-precopy_{context}"]
== Warm migration precopy stage

. Create an initial snapshot of running VM disks.
. Copy first snapshot to target: full-disk transfer, the largest amount of data copied. It takes more time to complete.
. Copy deltas: changed data, copying only data that has changed since the last snapshot was taken. It takes less time to complete.
.. Create a new snapshot.
.. Copy the delta between the previous snapshot and the new snapshot.
.. Schedule the next snapshot, configurable by default, one hour after the last snapshot finished.
. An arbitrary number of deltas can be copied.

[id="mtv-cold-warm-migration-cutover_{context}"]
== Preparing the cutover stage for a warm migration

. Scheduled time to finalize warm migration.
. Shut down the source VM.
. Copy the final snapshot delta to the target.
. Continue in the same way as cold migration.
.. Guest conversion.
.. Starting target VM (optional).
