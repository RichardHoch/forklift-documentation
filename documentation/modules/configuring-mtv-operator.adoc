= Configuring the {operator-name}

You can configure the following settings of the {operator-name} using either the CLI or the user interface.

* Maximum number of virtual machines (VMs) per plan that can be migrated simultaneously
* How long `must gather` reports are retained before being automatically deleted
* CPU limit allocated to the main controller container
* Memory limit allocated to the main controller container
* Interval at which a new snapshot is requested before initiating a warm migration
* Frequency with which the system checks the status of snapshot creation or removal during a warm migration
* Percentage of space in persistent volumes allocated as file system overhead when the `storageclass` is `filesystem` (CLI only)

These settings are configured by changing the default of the appropriate parameter in the `spec` part of the `forklift-controller` CR.

The procedure for configuring these settings using the user interface is presented in xref:mtv-overview-page_{context}[Configuring MTV settings]. The procedure for configuring these settings using the CLI is presented following.

.Procedure

* Change a parameter's value in  the `spec` portion of the `forklift-controller` CR by adding the label and value as follows:
[source, YAML]
----
spec:
  label: value <1>
----
<1> Labels you can configure using the CLI are shown in the table that follows, along with a description of each label and its default value.

|Label |Description |Default value

|`controller_max_vm_inflight`
|The maximum number of VMs per plan that can be migrated simultaneously.
|`20`

|`must_gather_api_cleanup_max_age`
|The duration in hours for retaining `must gather` reports before they are automatically deleted.
|`-1` (disabled)

|`controller_container_limits_cpu`
|The CPU limit allocated to the main controller container.
|`500m`

|`controller_container_limits_memory`
|The memory limit allocated to the main controller container.
|`800Mi`

|`controller_precopy_interval`
|The interval in minutes at which a new snapshot is requested before initiating a warm migration.
|`60`

|`controller_snapshot_status_check_rate_seconds`
|The frequency in seconds with which the system checks the status of snapshot creation or removal during a warm migration.
|`10`

|`controller_filesystem_overhead`
|Percentage of space in persistent volumes allocated as file system overhead when the `storageclass` is `filesystem`. Note, this setting can only be changed using the CLI.
|`10`

|`controller_block_overhead`
|Fixed amount of additional space allocated in persistent block volumes. This setting is applicable for any `storageclass` that is block-based. It can be used when data, such as encryption headers, is written to the persistent volumes in addition to the content of the virtual disk. Note, this setting can only be changed using the CLI.
