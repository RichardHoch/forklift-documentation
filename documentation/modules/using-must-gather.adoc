= Using the must-gather tool

You can collect logs and information about {project-short} custom resources (CRs) by using the `must-gather` tool. You must attach a `must-gather` data file to all customer cases.

.Prerequisites

* You must be logged in to the {virt} cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You must have the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp-version}/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[{ocp} CLI (`oc`)] installed.

.Collecting logs and CR information

. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the `must-gather` data.
. Run the `oc adm must-gather` command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image={must-gather}
----
+
The data is saved as `/must-gather/must-gather.tar.gz`. You can upload this file to a support case on the link:https://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal].
