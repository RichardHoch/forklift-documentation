= Upgrading {the-lc} {project-full}

You can upgrade the {operator-name} by using the {ocp} web console to install the new version.

[NOTE]
====
You must upgrade to the next release without skipping a release, for example, from 2.0 to 2.1 or from 2.1 to 2.2.
====

.Procedure

. In the {ocp-short} web console, click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* -> *{operator-name-ui}* -> *Subscription*.

. Change the update channel to the correct release.

ifeval::["{build}" == "upstream"]
See link:https://docs.okd.io/latest/operators/admin/olm-upgrading-operators.html#olm-changing-update-channel_olm-upgrading-operators[Changing update channel] in the {ocp} documentation.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" == "downstream"]
See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-version}/html/operators/administrator-tasks#olm-changing-update-channel_olm-upgrading-operators[Changing update channel] in the {ocp} documentation.

. Confirm that *Upgrade status* changes from *Up to date* to *Upgrade available*. If it does not, restart the `CatalogSource` pod:

..  Note the catalog source, for example, `redhat-operators`.
..  From the command line, retrieve the catalog source pod:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ {oc} get pod -n openshift-marketplace | grep <catalog_source>
----

..  Delete the pod:
+
[source,terminal,subs=attributes+]
----
$ {oc} delete pod -n openshift-marketplace <catalog_source_pod>
----
+
*Upgrade status* changes from *Up to date* to *Upgrade available*.
+
If you set *Update approval* on the *Subscriptions* tab to *Automatic*, the upgrade starts automatically.
+
. If you set *Update approval* on the *Subscriptions* tab to *Manual*, approve the upgrade.
+

. Verify that the `forklift-ui` pod is in a `Ready` state before you log in to the web console:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ {oc} get pods -n {namespace}
----
+
.Example output
----
NAME                                  READY  STATUS   RESTARTS  AGE
forklift-controller-788bdb4c69-mw268  2/2    Running  0         2m
forklift-operator-6bf45b8d8-qps9v     1/1    Running  0         5m

. If you added VMware source providers to {project-short} 2.2, upgrading to {project-short} 2.3 changes the state of any VMware providers to Critical. To fix this problem, edit the VMwhere provider by adding a VDDK `init` image and verifying the certificate of the VMware provider. For more information see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/2.2/html/installing_and_using_the_migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/migrating-vms-web-console#adding-source-provider_vmware[Addding a VMSphere source provider].

. If you mapped to NFS on the {ocp} destination provider in {project-short} 2.2, upgrading to {project-short} 2.3 invalidates the NFS mapping. To fix this problem, edit the `AccessModes` and `VolumeMode` parameters in the NFS storage profile. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html-single/virtualization/index#virt-customizing-storage-profile_virt-creating-data-volumes[Customizing the storage profile].
