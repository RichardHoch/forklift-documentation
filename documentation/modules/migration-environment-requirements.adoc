= Migration environment requirements

Check your migration environment to ensure that the following requirements are met.

.VMware environment requirements

* VMware vSphere must be version 6.5 or later.
* If you are migrating more than 10 VMs from an ESXi host in the same migration plan, you must increase the NFC service memory of the host.
* Virtual machines:
** link:https://www.vmware.com/support/ws5/doc/new_guest_tools_ws.html[VMware Tools] is installed.
** ISO/CDROM disks are unmounted.
** NIC has no more than one IPv4 and/or one IPv6 address.

** VM name does not duplicate the name of a VM in the {virt} environment.
** Operating system is certified and supported link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/973163#ocpvirt[for use as a guest operating system with {virt}] _and_ link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1351473[for conversion to KVM with `virt-v2v`].

.Network requirements
