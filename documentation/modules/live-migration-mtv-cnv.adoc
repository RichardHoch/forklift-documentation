= Live migration, {project-short}, and {virt}

[role="_abstract"]
Live migration is a joint operation between {project-first} and {virt} that allows you to leverage the strengths of {project-short} when you migrate virtual machines (VMs) from one {virt} cluster to another. Tasks and responsibilities are divided between the two as follows:

* {project-short} handles the high-level orchestration that is needed to perform a live migration of {virt} Kubevirt VMs from one cluster to another. 

* {virt} is responsible for the low-level migration mechanics, such as the actual state and storage transfer between the clusters.

Orchestration is done by the `ForkliftController` component of {project-short}, rather than by {virt}, because `ForkliftController` is already designed to manage the migration pipeline, which includes the following responsibilities:

* Build an inventory of source resources and map them to the destination cluster.
* Create and run the migration plan.
* Ensure that all necessary shared resources, such as instance types, SSH keys, secrets, and config maps, are available and accessible on the destination cluster.
